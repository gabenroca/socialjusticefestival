# Project Overview

This webpage emphasizes on the concept of a personal scrapbook, capturing and highlighting unforgettable memories. In these pages are photos from Gabriel's digital camera and maps of his trips, illustrating Gabriel's interests and journey around the world.

# Technical Overview
The website is created with HTML to lay out the content and styled through CSS. 

There are four pages that can be explored in the side navigation on the left: Home, About, Places, and Maps. 

The Home page includes a GIF that was created on Procreate through frame-by-frame drawings. Rainbow text was created by making each letter it's own class and giving different colors to each of them on CSS. 

The navigation was created by keeping it at a fixed position and using paddings for spacing. To get the hover effect of a differnt color, a transition was applied on CSS as well as a selected background color. 

Each page utilzed paddings for alignment and spacing content. 

The styling was made by using the 'div' tag to create classes.
